# orm-e-commerce

## Description

Back-end application for an e-commerce site. A working Express.js API was configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database with the intent to provide a manager for an internet retail company with a competitive technology operational within the constructs of e-commerce.

Given a functional Express.js API, the user adds the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file which enable the user to connect to a database using Sequelize.

Utilizing schema and seeds commands generates a development database that is created and seeded with test data.

When the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

When user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia allows user to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
